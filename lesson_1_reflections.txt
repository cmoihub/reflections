How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It proved to be quite useful. I have no idea how else it could've been accomplished

Viewing history through version control?
It would allow to check for mistakes in recent updates
It would also make it easier to restore files

Pros & Cons of manually choosing when to create commit vs autosave
The manual method seems more logical however if one forgets to note a particular change made this prove unhelpful
Autosave guarantees that your work will always be saved at a given checkpoint however it also means that code might end up being meaningless and not able to compile
You may also not want to save a particular change.  You could be running tests. If these changes are acknowledged by your autosave feature they may prove to be confusing later on

Why do some version control systems e.g. GIT  allow saving multiple files completely whereas others like Google Docs treat the files separately?
GIT may do this because it recognizes that there is some connection or logical relation between the files.

Git log: simply shows all commits made, including author,email and date
Git diff: uses commit ids obtained from the log for comparing files. This helps to show all the changes made to such files
